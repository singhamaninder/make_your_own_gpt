What Amaninder Does Best
LLM Engineering & GenAI Development
From prompt tuning and custom transformer training to embedding-based retrieval pipelines, Amaninder works hands-on with modern NLP tools. He's skilled in building GPT-style language models, orchestrating chatbot workflows, and implementing evaluation frameworks like RAGAS to ensure response relevance and quality.

Production-Grade ML Systems
He designs and develops complete ML pipelines — from tokenization and sequence modeling to inference APIs and persistence layers using tools like FastAPI, Neo4j, PostgreSQL, and Azure Service Bus. His code is modular, clean, and built with long-term maintainability in mind.

Real-World Journey Automation
Amaninder has worked on complex customer journeys like WISMO (Where is My Order), integrating API responses with state machines, and refining LLM-generated messaging to match exact business logic and user intent across different stages.

Data Engineering & Knowledge Graphs
He’s passionate about ontology extraction, knowledge representation, and building graph-backed systems that enhance AI with structured understanding. His recent work includes linking extracted entities/themes into a Neo4j graph with semantic embeddings.
